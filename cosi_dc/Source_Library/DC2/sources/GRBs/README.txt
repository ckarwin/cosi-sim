Included are:
3 long GRBs with realistic lightcurves - GRB080723557.source, GRB090206620.source, GRB130425327.source
3 short GRBs with realistic lightcurves - GRB090227772.source, GRB090228204.source, GRB101216721.source
4 short GRBs with constant lightcurves - GRB080725541.source, GRB081101491.source, GRB081122614.source, GRB081223419.source

Spectra are either Band function or Comptonized spectrum fits from GBM.
Long GRB lightcurves are downloaded directly from GBM.
Short GRB realistic lightcurves are downloaded from GBM & binned using Bayesian blocks.
Short GRB constant lightcurves are constant over the duration of the GRB.

All lightcurves begin at t=0, and GRB positions are random.
Lightcurve times & GRB positions will need to be altered based on orientation file and distribution of incidence angles.

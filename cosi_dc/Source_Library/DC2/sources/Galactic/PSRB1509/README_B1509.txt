This is the description to the source model of pulsar -- PSR B1509-58
3 pulsars with different flux level are included in DC2-Galactic-Pulsar

Target: PSR J1513-5908 (B1509-58)
Pulse profile and Spectrum: Kuiper et al. 2015, MNRAS 449, 3827 https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stv426
The source is divided into 3 energy bands.
Band1 100-250 keV
Band2 250-750 keV
Band3 0.75-10 MeV

Goal: Detection, Phase-integrated spectrum, Phase-resolved spectrum(DC3 or later), Pulse profile(DC3 or later)

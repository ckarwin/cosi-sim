The two spectral models for Cyg X1 are best fit eqpair  models of time averaged INTEGRAL data 
(Cangemi et al 2021, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...650A..93C/abstract), 
given for hard and soft states respectively.
In DC2 we would like to use hard spectrum for year 1 and then soft spectrum
for year 2 of COSI operations (i.e. 50 % of the time spent in each state).
This is to check how good detection can be achieved in soft state. This could also be used to 
test how well COSI can be used as a monitor to detect such a spectral transition/change.  
Note: model for hard state different from the one used in DC1 and less optimistic at high energies.

This is the description of the source model of the galactic positrons in-flight annihilation emission.

Target: Positrons_In_Flight_Annihilation
The spectral and spatial characteristics of that diffuse emission were obtained from the analyses of COMPTEL/GRO data 
described in Knödlseder et al. (2025 - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...700A.257K/abstract).

The source is modeled with a 3.3deg width (standard deviation) 2D Gaussian shape emission centered at l = -1.4 deg, b = -0.2 deg. 
The spectral distribution, which is described in the file Positrons_In_Flight_Annihilation_spec.dat, is one 
of the best fitting spectral models (see Fig. 4c of Knödlseder et al. 2025).
The total flux in the 100 keV-10 MeV band is 0.00031 ph/s/cm2. 

Goal: Detection of the galactic positrons in-flight annihilation emission.

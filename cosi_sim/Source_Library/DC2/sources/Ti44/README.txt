This is the description of the source models for point like 44Ti line emission in the Galaxy at 1157.02 keV

There are four models of supernova remnants with the 44Ti line emission only included.

The line is a broadened Gaussian with a Doppler broadening of 5000 km/s, corresponding to roughly 8.2 keV (1 sigma value).

For this data challange, only the fluxes are important, so that we see if we detect the sources.

The sources are:
Cas A
SN1987A
G1.9+0.3
Betelgeuse (SNsurprise)

The .source files provided are for the actually expected flux, and 50 times the expected flux for these sources to check
for us how many photons to expect in the broadened line, and for the data challange to "count" the supernova remnants.


Goals: Identification of 44Ti sources in the Milky Way.
Creating TS maps in only the 44Ti line (probably with an approximated line response).
Fitting the spectrum of a Gaussian line only at inferred positions.


Files:
The .source files are copied from a template and the names, coordinates, and fluxes are changed accordingly.

This folder contains the spectral model of the blazar 3C 273. The baseline model can be found in Madsen et al 2015. 

The columns in each file are: Format <Energy in keV> <Spectrum in ph cm^-2 s^-1 keV^-1>
The energy band used is 100 keV to 10000 keV

3C_273_COSI.dat     - average state of the source 
3C_273_COSI_x10.dat - source 10x brighter than the average state

The goal of these data for COSI is: determine flux in the COSI band, and spectral index

NOTE: only the flux has been increased by 10x, while the spectral index is the same in both models.

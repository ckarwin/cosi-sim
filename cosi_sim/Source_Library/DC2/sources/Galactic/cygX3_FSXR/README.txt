The 6 different spectral models for Cyg X3 are best fit eqpair  models of time averaged INTEGRAL data 
(Cangemi et al 2021, https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2021/01/aa37951-20.pdf).
In DC2 we would like to assume a succession of the different states :

            % of time of observed state    ->    time in days (for a 2 year mission)
Quiescent:  6.                                    47
Transition  46.                                   335
FHXR:       10.                                   73
FIM:        22.                                   161
FSXR:       54.                                   28
Hypersoft:  12.                                   86

In this order and for the specified approximate durations. 

If DC2 simulates less than 2 years of observation then reduce the time spent in each states accordingly and 
increase the fluxes as to obtain the same total number of photons as we would in 2 yrs of observations. 

This is to check  if COSI could achieve a decent measurement of the average spectrum over its life time 
and if so, check if we can detect the spectral changes on shorter time scales.

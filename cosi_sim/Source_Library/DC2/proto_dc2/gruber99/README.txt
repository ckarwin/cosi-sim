This model uses an isotropic source with the Gruber+99 spectral model. 
It does not account for the blockage of Earth, and thus it would be for
a detector sufficiently far away. 
This model was calculated independently from MEGAlib's BackgroundGenerator, 
and it gives identical results, thus serving as a sanity check.

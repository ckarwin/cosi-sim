This is a description of the source model for the 511 keV positron annihilation line (only) from the Vela SNR for DC3.

The idea is that all positrons from 1e-4 Msun of 44Ti decay are ASSUMED trapped within the remnant by magnetic fields. During the adiabatic phase, positrons continue to slow mainly in the shocked ISM / ejecta shell with density 4 times ambient. Assuming ambient density likely higher than inferred for Vela, positrons slow in some 40,000 years (lower KE ones sooner), and annihilate, giving a 511 keV flux at 10,000 years of 3.5e-4 cm^{-2} s^{-1} at 250 pc. 

Spatial: We assume the annihilation follows the total ROSAT all-sky survey X-ray emission. This is NOT a point source, but ~8 deg in extent.

The image is in the file vela_511_100.fits, which still needs to be converted to the Cosima format in Vela_SNR_511.dat.

Spectral: Monochromatic emission at 511 keV.


Goals: 
1) Detect extended 511 keV source in outer disk.
2) Map extended 511 keV source.
3) Ultimately, assess possible contribution of SNR's to "diffuse" emission.

This is the description of the source model of the 1809 keV line emission from the decays of 26Al in the Cygnus region for DC3.

Target: 26Al_Cyg_Region
The characteristics of that diffuse emission were obtained from the analyses of SPI/INTEGRAL observations 
described in Martin et al. (2009 - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...506..703M/abstract).

The source is modeled with a 3deg width (standard deviation) Gaussian shape emission centered 
at l = 81 deg, b = 1 deg. The line flux is 3.9e-5 ph/s/cm2. It is centered at 1808.8 keV and its width is 1.6 keV (FWHM)
due to the interstellar turbulence. 

Goal: Detection taking into account the Galactic ("background") 1809 keV emission, width of the gamma-ray line, 
recover 60Fe/26Al ratio (see 60Fe_Cyg_Region).

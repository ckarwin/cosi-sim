This is the description of the source model of the 1173 keV and 1332 keV emissions from the decays of 60Fe in the Cygnus region for DC3.

Target: 60Fe_Cyg_Region
The flux of the 60Fe lines is derived from the calculation of Martin et al. (2010 - see Fig. 2 top of https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26A...511A..86M/abstract)
The spatial extent of this diffuse emission is the same as the one of the 1809 keV line emission that were obtained from the analyses of SPI/INTEGRAL observations 
described in Martin et al. (2009 - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...506..703M/abstract).

The source is modeled with a 3deg width (standard deviation) Gaussian shape emission centered at l = 81 deg, b = 1 deg. The line fluxes are 
2.7e-6 ph/s/cm2 for the both line. The line energies are 1173.3 keV and 1332.6 keV and their width are 1.04 keV and 1.18 keV (FWHM), 
respectively (broadening due to the interstellar turbulence). 

Goal: Detection taking into account the Galactic ("background") 1173 keV and 1332 keV emissions, width of the gamma-ray lines, 
recover 60Fe/26Al ratio (see 26Al_Cyg_Region).

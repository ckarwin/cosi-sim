This is the same as in DC2
The 2 spectral models for 1E1740.7-2942 (also know as great annihilator) are the best fit models
 of INTEGRAL data obtained by Bouchet et al. (2009, https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/693/2/1871/pdf):
 - compow: thermal comptonization + power law
 - twocompt: two components of thermal comptonization with different temperatures
 
 Both models represent the INTEGRAL data well but strongly differ at the highest energies. 
 We would like to test whether COSI would be able to distinguish between those models 
 Ideally we would need two have two model options in DC2 for 1E1740...
 A simpler option could be to use the compow model for the first half of the DC2 simulation
(first year ?)  and twocompt for the second half of the time.

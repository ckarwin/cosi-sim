The two spectral models for Cyg X1 are best fit eqpair  models of time averaged INTEGRAL data 
(Cangemi et al 2021, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...650A..93C/abstract), 
given for hard and soft states respectively.
In DC3 we would like to use hard spectrum for year 1 and then soft spectrum
for year 2 of COSI operations (i.e. 50 % of the time spent in each state).
This is to check how good detection can be achieved in soft state. This could also be used to 
test how well COSI can be used as a monitor to detect such a spectral transition/change.  

IN DC3 Polarization included for hard state ans soft state spectra. 
The hard state model is based on the measurements of Rodriguez et al. 2015 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...807...17R/abstract
cygX1_hard_0.1-0.4 is for the polarization at low energy
cygX1_hard_0.4-10  is for the polarization at high energy
In soft spectral state an energy independent polarization of 20% is assumed.

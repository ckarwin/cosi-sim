This is the description to the source model of a classical nova outburst for a CO type white dwarf at 1 kpc.

Target: nova_co
Light curves and spectral distribution are based on the model presented by Hernanz (2014) https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/2014ASPC..490..319H
The position in the sky is (arbitrarily) the same as V1369 Cen (2013): l = 310.9847 deg, b = 2.7256 deg

The source is divided into 3 components.
cont 	spectral continuum (100 < E < 520 keV) for t < 4 hours
511keV	511 keV line from e+ annihilation for t < 4 hours, with a width of 3 keV FWHM (sigma = 1.27 keV)
478keV  478 keV line from 7Be decays, with a width of 8 keV FWHM (sigma = 3.4 keV)

Goal: Detection, light curve profiles, width of the gamma-ray lines

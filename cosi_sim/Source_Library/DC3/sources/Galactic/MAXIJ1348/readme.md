The spectral model of MAXI J1348-630 is a scan of published INTEGRAL data shown in Fig 3 of
Cangemi et al 2023(https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...669A..65C/abstract ), in hard state. 
The polarimetric model corresponds to the measurements shown in table 3 of the same paper.
MAXIJ1348_0.1-0.4  is the polarization model at low energy
MAXIJ1348_0.4-10  is the polarization  model  at high energy
The aim  is to test our ability to measure spectra and polarization of transient sources.
MAXI J1348-630 remained in the HS during 7 days, for DC3 we would like to have a the source 
'ON' for 7 continuous days only, and OFF for the rest of the mission.

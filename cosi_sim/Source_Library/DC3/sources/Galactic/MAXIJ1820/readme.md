The spectral model for MAXIJ1820+070 is a scan of published INTEGRAL data shown in Fig 3 of
Cangemi et al 2023(https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...669A..65C/abstract ), in hard state. 
The polarimetric model corresponds to the measurements shown in table 3 of the same paper.
MAXIJ1820_0.1-0.4 is the model for low energy polarization 
MAXIJ1820_0.4-10  is the model for high energy polarization
The aim  is to test the our ability to measure spectra and polarization of transient sources.
Maxi 1820 remained in the HS during 60 days, for DC3 we would like to have a the source 
'ON' for 60 continuous days only and OFF for the rest of the mission.

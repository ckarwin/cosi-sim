This is the same model from DC2. The only difference is that we now add polarization. We use a polarization fraction of 19.62%, and a randomly chosen polarization angle of 45 degrees (in IAU convention)

The spectral data are 3c279low and high, which represent the low and high states of the source, and 50 and 100 mean that their flux is normalized by *50 or *100 for the data challenge.
The data format is in ASCII.

The goal for this data set is to examine if COSI can identify spectral curvature and changes during flares. The low state has two spectral components due to synchrotron self Compton and external Compton, while the high state is dominated by synchrotron self Compton.

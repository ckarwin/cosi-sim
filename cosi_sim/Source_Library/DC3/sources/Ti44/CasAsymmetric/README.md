# 44Ti-Cosima-simulations
Source simulations using Cosima for 44Ti line emissions. 

Author: Anaya Valluvan
FR: Fully Resolved
PR: Partially Resolved
UR: Unresolved
SYM: Symmetric (No asymmetry)

In all 4 scenarios, bulk centre of motion
is at rest. 
Doppler broadening is limited to 1000 km/s
as otherwise, when combined with the Doppler 
shifts of clumps, the signal will fall quite 
outside the DC2 simulated response region of 
1143-1171 keV.

In asymmetric scenarios,
Clump 1: Contains 2/3 of total 44Ti yield
Doppler shifted towards from the observer 
(blueshifted). Has peak energy higher than 1157 keV
Clump 2: Contains 1/3 of total 44Ti yield
Doppler shifted away from the observer 
(redshifted). Has peak energy lower than 1157 keV

All spectra follow simple Gaussian distributions. 
The flux is taken as the value between 2.1 x 10^-5 
in Grefenstette et al 2015 and 3.5 x 10^-5 ph/cm^2/s
in Siegert et al 2015

# Target
Annihilating MeV DM

# Model Description
-Files for DM annihilating into gamma-gamma or e-e-gamma, assuming NFW or Burkert profile.
-m_DM = 3 MeV and <sigma v> = 1e-30 cm3/s. Other parameters are detailed in our slides.
-The source file is set by default for DM annihilating into gamma-gamma assuming a Burkert profile. For other cases, change the name of the .dat file in the source file.
-We can consider darker or brighter sources by adjusting the normalization of the .dat files.

# Goal
DC3: Calculate the gamma-ray spectra from the annihilating MeV DM
DC3(if time allows) or DC4: Compare the spectra from DM and background, then reveal the COSIâ€™s detectability for attractive DM candidates.
